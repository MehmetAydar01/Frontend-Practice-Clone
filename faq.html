                        <h2>What is Frontend Practice?</h2>
                        <p>Frontend Practice is a collection of real and carefully chosen websites for developers to recreate as a way to improve and test their skills. We believe that a building from scratch approach will teach you a multitude of skills, including design, interactions, animations, troubleshooting, responsiveness, and more.</p>

                        <h2>Why did you pick these websites?</h2>
                        <p>Picking which websites to feature on Frontend Practice is a personal preference based on several factors, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Design & style.</li>
                            <li>Difficulty to recreate.*</li>
                            <li>Elements & features that offer a learning opportunity by recreating.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>*Some projects will be harder than others to recreate.</p>

                        <h2>I'm stuck! Where is the code?</h2>
                        <p>We try to provide a handful of resources to help with projects but there will always be an unforeseen challenge. This is where the learning really begins. We recommend troubleshooting these obstacles yourself or asking others for help. You may find using the developer tools on the live website very helpful also.</p>

                        <h2>Where do I find images and icons?</h2>
                        <p>Both <span>Pexels</span> & <span>Pixabay</span> provide great free stock photos.</p>
                        <p><span>Boxicons</span> & <span>Font Awesome</span> have a wide range of free icons.</p>

                        <p>How dare they update the website! We will talk with their manager right away. If they don't respond, we'll periodically check the websites we feature and make the necessary updates.</p>
                        <p>We might keep some previous designs and link to an archived page if we <span class="dark">really</span> love it.</p>

                    <div class="faqBox">
                        <h2>Can I use these in my portfolio?</h2>
                        <p>We would challenge you to make these projects your own by using your choice of colors, content, and images. If you do decide to use these projects for a portfolio piece, please make it known that it is "unofficial".</p>
                        <p>These are practice projects and any and all materials owned by companies and individuals whose websites are featured on Frontend Practice are meant for practice purposes only.</p>

                        <p>Of course! Feel free to <span>contact us</span> and share a website that you feel offers a learning opportunity by recreating. We will check it out and consider it.</p>
